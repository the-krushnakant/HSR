This repository contains analysis of potential high speed rail (HSR) routes in India.

### Consumer Insights

The government is building high speed rail using loans. Thus, the project must be financially viable, with a positive rate of return. This means that the prices of HSR will be extremely high, close to what it costs to take the airplane. The Indian consumer is extremely price sensitive. Hence, the number of people willing to spend money to travel by plane, will, at least comparatively, reflect the number of people willing to spend money to travel by HSR.

### Report and insights

The ridership table is given below. Some insights are:

1. The Delhi-Mumbai route has massive ridership potential unmatched by any other corridor. However, a simple extension of this route to Pune would result in as much as 21% increase. 
2. The Mumbai-Chennai route via Bengaluru is much more viable than any 
other route, even on a per-kilometre basis. This route, however, is 
not even being considered by government in favor of other 
shorter routes.
